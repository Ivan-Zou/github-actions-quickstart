### Practice using GitHub Actions

### Feedback
In the github-actions-demo.yml file, it utilizes context objects from "github.", "runner.", and "job.". The page currently does not provide information or link to page with all the available context objects and their descriptions. It would be useful for new users to be able to easily access information about all context objects usable in the GitHub Actions workflow, and a description explaining each context object. This could be done through a subsection or a link to another page containing this information.
